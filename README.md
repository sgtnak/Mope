**Rope** implements the insightface inswapper_128 model with a helpful GUI.

**Mope** removed the helpful GUI so it can run on a Linux machine (sortof).  
  
##### Changes

- Add support for running in shell. Check `Mope.py` and `Mock.py` for details.
- Uses `GFPGANv1.3.onnx` instead of v1.4. Should be no big difference though.
- Deleted `Rope.py` and `Rope.bat`, but they will still be completely functional if you put them back.
- Otherwise identical to Rope.

##### To-do

- Maybe better logging
